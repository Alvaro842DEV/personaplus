 * Calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) based on given parameters.
 * @param age The age of the subject.

BMI is an inexpensive and easy screening method for weight categoryâ€”underweight, healthy weight, overweight, and obesity. BMI does not measure body fat directly, but BMI is moderately correlated with more direct measures of body fat. Furthermore, BMI appears to be as strongly correlated with various metabolic and disease outcomes as are these more direct measures of body fatness.";
