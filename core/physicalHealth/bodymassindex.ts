// since i only have a visual graph and not a table, there is a very slight possible error margin (i have vision problems alright?). the error margin is of a max of 0.2

Furthermore, BMI appears to be as strongly correlated with various metabolic and disease outcomes as are these more direct measures of body fatness.";
