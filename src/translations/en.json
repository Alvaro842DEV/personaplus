Start with a comfortable number of repetitions and gradually increase as you build strength.\n\nTo do a one handed push-up, begin in a plank position with one hand centered beneath your shoulder and the other behind your back.

Start running at a pace that feels comfortable, and maintain a steady breathing pattern. Focus on keeping a good posture and staying relaxed. If you're a beginner, alternate between running and walking in intervals. Gradually increase your running time as your endurance improves. Cool down by walking for a few minutes and then stretching.",
            "Walking": "Wear comfortable shoes and clothing suitable for the weather. Begin by walking at a natural pace, allowing your arms to swing naturally at your sides. Focus on maintaining a good posture, with your back straight and your head up. You can vary your speed, incorporating brisk walking intervals to increase your heart rate. Walking can be done almost anywhere, so choose a route you enjoy. Aim for at least 30 minutes of walking per session, and gradually increase your duration and intensity as you build stamina.",

Begin to observe your thoughts and feelings without judgment, letting them come and go naturally. You can focus on your breath, a mantra, or simply the present moment. If your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to your focal point. Start with a few minutes and gradually extend your meditation time as you become more comfortable with the practice."
