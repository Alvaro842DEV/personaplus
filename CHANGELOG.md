# Registro de cambios de PersonaPlus (CHANGELOG)

COMO FUNCIONAN LAS VERSIONES // HOW DOES VERSIONING WORK:

Dividamos el desarrollo en dos fases, PRE-APP y POST-APP.

PRE-APP es donde estamos ahora, cuando las actualizaciones son a un cÃ³digo que todavÃ­a no estÃ¡ acabado (estamos en un punto en el que un APK serÃ­a inÃºtil, la app no sirve). Cada versiÃ³n / actualizaciÃ³n durante esta fase sumarÃ¡ 1 a `X` en `0.0.1-R5-bX`.

Cuando la app llegue a un punto en el que es utilizable y se publique el primer APK (probablemente en GitHub Releases), se lanzarÃ¡ como "0.0.1-R5" sin mÃ¡s. A partir de ahÃ­ entramos en fase POST-APP:

- Versiones que arreglen bugs, errores, o mejoren el rendimiento, sin hacer cambios, sumarÃ¡n 1 a 0.0.X-R5.
- Versiones con cambios, mejoras, o que hagan una diferencia en la app, sumarÃ¡n a 0.X.0-R5.
- Cuando todas las funciones principales / bÃ¡sicas estÃ©n implementadas y testeadas, se pasarÃ¡ a la 1.0.0-R5.
- Si se estÃ¡ en X.X.9, pero se siguen lanzado actualizaciones que deberÃ­an sumar al 9, sencillamente se seguirÃ¡ sumando (p ej. 0.0.10-R5).

- PD: Los logs serÃ¡n en inglÃ©s, siempre.

## 0.0.1-R5-b20

- Started working on the logic - as a side project: "OpenHealth".

> [!INFO]
> **What does that even mean?** See: Basically, the app needs to work with a lot of health data so that it can provide accurate statistics and tips to the end user, so the first idea would be to find a library or something that does provide functions for that stuff. However - I thought it would be a nice idea to try to make our own "health.js" library, and just like that! There's a new directory called `/code` for _the core of the app_, this new library which will allow PersonaPlus to turn all that frontend objectives into actual, worthy data for users to understand themselves, their performance, and their health.

Quick note: OpenHealth will have **it's own changelog**, on `core/CHANGELOG.md`. It's mentioned here only this time, as this is the (huge and) only change of this update.

## 0.0.1-R5-b19

- Renamed most variables to take a more descriptive and easy to understand approach.
- Decided to set an internal standard for console logging: `termLog` (imported from `DeveloperInterface.tsx`). This will `console.log` and log for Dev interface aswell.

## 0.0.1-R5-b18

- Fixed some typos.
- Now, objectives won't be shown in your Home if you don't have to do them today.
- A few other changes.

## 0.0.1-R5-b17

- Fixed a few typos, like "1 MINUTES".
- Fixed a bug where OBJS got saved without an exercise name. Also, while not a bug, this fix also fixed you being able to store an objective that lasted for 0 minutes (imposible to do).
- Added a function to remove an OBJ from the Dashboard (`/Dash`).
- Fixed app not refreshing when marked an OBJ as done.
- Made several improvements to types.
- Fixed many visual mistakes and improved layouts. _Particullary, for some reason using `vertical` `order` on `<BeSwap>` caused a really hard to explain visual bug on the Welcome ("`/Welc`") screen. It was "fixed" by changing the order prop to `horizontal`._
- Improved the flow of username changes.
- Added React & PersonaPlus versions to the Dev interface.
- Made Dev interface opt-in, via `useDevTools` item in AsyncStorage.
  - You can opt-in (or opt-out) again via the Profile tab ("`/Prof`").
- Other small changes and a few performance improvements.

> [!NOTE]
>
> ### **FIXED ERRORS - Latest**
>
> `b11:` For some reason, sometimes the `exercise` prop from the objective's Object does not get stored on creation, giving it an empty name. **This was fixed by adding a placeholder invalid option, forcing the user to choose an option so `setExercise` gets called.**
> `b15`: For some reason, the `objs`' name is not being displayed on mobile devices on Expo Go. **Fixing the error above also fixed this.**

## 0.0.1-R5-b16

- Made more changes to match the requirements of ESLint.
- Made a lof of UI and design changes to improve the looks on mobile - _this lead to things looking bad on desktop -_ _**it's not a problem, as the only target devices are phones.**_
- Made a peculiar change ;] - moved the bottom navigation bar to the top.
- Added a "Dev" tab designed to help during testing, specially on mobile. Has shortcuts for things that can be done from desktop but not mobile, like clearing `OBJS`.
- Created a function `testLog` designed specifically to make "console logs" for this tab, as sometimes regular `console.log` calls don't appear on the console's replica for the Dev tab.
- Made some progress with the apps' content.
- Made some improvements to types and other aspects of the codebase.
- Updated `DOCS.md`, `README.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` so that they look a bit more professional.
- Other small changes and improvements.

## 0.0.1-R5-b15

- Made several UI changes to improve the looks on end user mobile devices. There's still work to do, but good progress was made.
- Made adjustments to the ESLINT config.
- Other changes to the logic used to structure and render some components to ensure they look good.
- Added a few extra comments to the code to explain some stuff better.
- Made a few changes like replacing some `let` with `const` to match the requirements of ESLint.

## 0.0.1-R5-b14

### Updated Expo from SDK 50 to SDK 51 ðŸŽ‰

- Small extra changes.

> `b9:` Console spamming "`Unexpected text node: . A text node cannot be a child of a <View>.`". _The error was a stupid inline comment, LOL._
> **And thanks to this fix, app was finally properly tested on mobile!**

**Note:**
> Now that it was finally possible to test on mobile, a LOT of visual issues were found. Will be adressed progressively.

## 0.0.1-R5-b13

- Now you can mark an objective as done.

> [!NOTE]
> KNOWN ERRORS remain the same as on `b11`

## 0.0.1-R5-b12

- Created `Sess.tsx`, page for live sessions. Still not done.
- Made very small changes to code documentation and applied them code-wide.

> [!NOTE]
> KNOWN ERRORS remain the same as on `b11`

## 0.0.1-R5-b11

- Fixed the `key` prop not being used properly in `Dash.tsx`.
- Fixed the "Create active objective" button being spammed on the UI when there _are_ created objectives.
- Added a new First launch check on the `index.tsx` page. Will redirect to `/Welc` (welcome screen) if `hasLaunched` item does not exist in LocalStorage. Also, it gets created so you don't get redirected each time you open PersonaPlus, only on the first launch.
- Updated the `Swap` component, now supports new optional property `order` which is equivalent to _`flex-direction`_.
- Fixed errors with the `Crea.tsx` page:
  - Not creating objs.
  - Not going home when an obj is created.

## 0.0.1-R5-b9
