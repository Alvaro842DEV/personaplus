                            It&apos;s clear what it is. An app designed to help
                            you be better. Currently it&apos;s on a very early
                            stage of development, so I can&apos;t say (yet)
                            it&apos;s a revolution. But it is, indeed, a piece
                            of hard work designed to make your life better.

                            I&apos;m Zaka and I Do Stuff. I&apos;ve been since
                            2023 working on this as my first ever React project.
                            Yep, this is my first time coding with the
                            technology that powers the app! I didn&apos;t want
                            to start with a test project that would end on the
                            garbage, I wanted to make something useful, and here
                            I am!

                            contributors yet, but remember this is a fully open
                            source app! You can help it grow at any time, and
